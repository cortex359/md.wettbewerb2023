   abstract = {We motivate and visualize problems and methods for packing a set of objects into a given container, in particular a set of \{different-size\} circles or squares into a square or circular container. Questions of this type have attracted a considerable amount of attention and are known to be notoriously hard. We focus on a particularly simple criterion for deciding whether a set can be packed: comparing the total area A of all objects to the area C of the container. The critical packing density delta^* is the largest value A/C for which any set of area A can be packed into a container of area C. We describe algorithms that establish the critical density of squares in a square (delta^*=0.5), of circles in a square (delta^*=0.5390 ...), regular octagons in a square (delta^*=0.5685 ...), and circles in a circle (delta^*=0.5).},

   abstract = {The linear models for the approximate solution of the problem of packing the maximum number of equal circles of the given radius into a given closed bounded domain G are proposed. We construct a grid in G; the nodes of this grid form a finite set of points T, and it is assumed that the centers of circles to be packed can be placed only at the points of T. The packing problems of equal circles with the centers at the points of T are reduced to 0-1 linear programming problems. A heuristic algorithm for solving the packing problems based on linear models is proposed. This algorithm makes it possible to solve packing problems for arbitrary connected closed bounded domains independently of their shape in a unified manner. Numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach are presented. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of packing unequal circles into a two-dimensional rectangular container. We solve this problem by proposing two greedy algorithms. The first algorithm, denoted by B1.0, selects the next circle to place according to the maximum-hole degree rule, that is inspired from human activity in packing. The second algorithm, denoted by B1.5, improves B1.0 with a self-look-ahead search strategy. The comparisons with the published methods on several instances taken from the literature show the good performance of our approach. © 2005 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@thesis{Lopez2013,
   abstract = {The two-dimension packing problem is concerned with the arrangement of items without overlaps inside a container. In particular we have considered the case when the items are circular objects, some of the general examples that can be found in the industry are related with packing, storing and transportation of circular objects. Although there are several approaches we want to investigate the use of formulation space search. Formulation space search is a fairly recent method that provides an easy way to escape from local optima for non-linear problems allowing to achieve better results. Despite the fact that it has been implemented to solve the packing problem with identical circles, we present an improved implementation of the formulation space search that gives better results for the case of identical and non-identical circles, also considering that they are packed inside different shaped containers, for which we provide the needed modifications for an appropriate implementation. The containers considered are: the unit circle, the unit square, two rectangles with different dimension (length 5, width 1 and length 10 width 1), a right-isosceles triangle, a semicircle and a right-circular quadrant. Results from the tests conducted shown several improvements over the best previously known for the case of identical circles inside three different containers: a right-isosceles triangle, a semicircle and a circular quadrant. In order to extend the scope of the formulation space search approach we used it to solve mixed-integer non-linear problems, in particular those with zero-one variables. Our findings suggest that our implementation provides a competitive way to solve these kind of problems.},

@article{Dong2019,
   abstract = {The Circle Packing Theorem states that every planar graph can be represented
as the tangency graph of a family of internally-disjoint circles. A well-known
generalization is the Primal-Dual Circle Packing Theorem for 3-connected planar
graphs. The existence of these representations has widespread applications in
theoretical computer science and mathematics; however, the algorithmic aspect
has received relatively little attention. In this work, we present an algorithm
based on convex optimization for computing a primal-dual circle packing
representation of maximal planar graphs, i.e. triangulations. This in turn
gives an algorithm for computing a circle packing representation of any planar
graph. Both take $\widetilde\{O\}(n \log(R/\varepsilon))$ expected run-time to
produce a solution that is $\varepsilon$ close to a true representation, where
$R$ is the ratio between the maximum and minimum circle radius in the true
representation.},

@article{He2015,
   abstract = {This paper proposes an action-space-based global optimization (ASGO) approach for the problem of packing unequal circles into a square container such that the size of the square is minimized. Starting from several random configurations, ASGO runs the following potential descent method and basin-hopping strategy iteratively. It finds configurations with the local minimum potential energy by the limited-memory BFGS (LBFGS) algorithm, then selects the circular items having the most deformations and moves them to some large vacant space or randomly chosen vacant space. By adapting the action space defined for the rectangular packing problem, we approximate each circular item as a rectangular item, thus making it much easier to find comparatively larger vacant spaces for any given configuration. The tabu strategy is used to prevent cycling and enhance the diversification during the search procedure. Several other strategies, such as swapping two similar circles or swapping two circles in different quadrants in the container, are combined to increase the diversity of the configurations. We compare the performance of ASGO on 68 benchmark instances at the Packomania website with the state-of-the-art results. ASGO obtains configurations with smaller square containers on 63 instances; at the same time it matches or approaches the current best results on the other five instances.},

   abstract = {In this paper we present a heuristic algorithm based on the formulation space search method to solve the circle packing problem. The circle packing problem is the problem of finding the maximum radius of a specified number of identical circles that can be fitted, without overlaps, into a two-dimensional container of fixed size. In this paper we consider a variety of containers: the unit circle, unit square, rectangle, isosceles right-angled triangle and semicircle. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem involving both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems. Formulation space search consists of switching between different formulations of the same problem, each formulation potentially having different properties in terms of nonlinear optimization. As a component of our heuristic we solve a nonlinear optimization problem using the solver SNOPT. Our heuristic improves on previous results based on formulation space search presented in the literature. For a number of the containers we improve on the best result previously known. Our heuristic is also a computationally effective approach (when balancing quality of result obtained against computation time required) when compared with other work presented in the literature. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
